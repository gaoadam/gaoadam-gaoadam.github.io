# Filters, Signals, and Neural Networks
*insert rainbow here*

## Introduction

A song may be rich with all kinds of information. You might have vocals, bass, drums, guitar, not to mention the potential echoing of the room and all kinds of cool nonlinear effects like distortion.

Yet, audio engineers mix and master these signals, sometimes in shockingly simple ways.

Let's say an audio engineer is limited to just the entire song recording and can't directly access individual instrument recordings. They are still able to separate the signal into mutiple frequency bands and edit the bands individually.

This sort of approach is common in atmospheric research as well. For example, different chemicals in the air (e.g. methane) can be differentiated by their different "spectral signatures". These signatures are obtainable from signals generated by pulse responses from laser sources.

So, how might we assist a neural network's prediction capability with these kinds of methods?

## Filters and Training

Let's try taking a signal and separating it into two different frequency bands.
